Magic Item maker for Dungeons and Dragons 
This uses React, Redux, and Webpack.

!! 
Semantic-ui included but dont know if you have to have gulp install for build
if gulp is required install gulp globally and cd semantic && gulp build
note requires connection to web to cdn in jquery for semantic.
!!
Commenting soon to come. 

Fetch not required yet for api calls not built.

If any one has any hints on how to make the reducer less bulk much apprecatied!


Plans: 
  1: Finish front end and add ability to upload pictures. Or add free art items for quick image.
  
  2: Make login component
  
  3: Create landing page for user to login.
  
  4: Create back-end using node and express as server
  
  5: Use MongoDB for user login and weapon saving.
  
  6: Create json api for other sites to use weapon if wish (Rolld20, opendnd)
  
  7: Create Item Card maker for Dungeon Masters to print or email to players.
